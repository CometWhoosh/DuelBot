# DuelBot

DuelBot is a Discord bot that allows users to engage in Wild West duels with each other.

## How Does it Work?

Users can challenge each other with the command `!duel challenge user_name`. Then, the challenged user will be prompted to accept or decline the challenge. If they accept, then instructions for how to proceed will be sent. The users involved in the duel will be prompted to send the command `!duel ready` to notify the bot that they are ready to duel. Once both users ready up, a countdown starts. Then, the users must send the message `!duel draw` followed by `!duel fire`. The first user to "fire their gun" (type out `!duel fire`) wins the duel.
